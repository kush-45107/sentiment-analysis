# 😊 Sentiment Analysis System

**A machine learning based sentiment classification system that categorizes text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.**

---

## 📌 Project Description
The **Sentiment Analysis System** analyzes textual data and classifies user input into **positive, negative, or neutral sentiments**.  
The project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and supervised machine learning techniques for text classification.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to build an automated system that can understand and classify human sentiments from text data.
